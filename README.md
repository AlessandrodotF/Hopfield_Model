# Hopfield Model
Project on Hopfield Model for Laboratory of Computational Physics at UniPD.

The first part Hopfield_model_with_vectors is used to explain Hopfield model and how it works. It shows a simple example using random generated patterns made by +1 and -1 numbers and random corrupted patterns, defined by a grade of corruption $q$ respect to the original ones.

The second part Hopfield_model_with_MNIST is the main part of the project. It shows how we were able to reconstruct corrupted images of handwritten number using the Hopfield model. It has some statistical parts used to reach the best approach to the model.
